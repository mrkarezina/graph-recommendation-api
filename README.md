# Graph Recommendation API

The graph recommendation api is used to provide recommendations for related content based on the underlying
knowledge graph stored in a Neo4j Database. The [data pipeline](https://github.com/mrkarezina/news-explorer-pipeline) uses several microservices to set up the
actual knowledge graph. The API can also be used to provide explainable content recommendations, meaning relations to related content are explained.

The API can be used to power chatbots, voice apps (Google Assistant / Alexa), and web applications for media sites. It provides endpoints for summaries, related content, and explainable related content. The API is responsible for querying the Neo4j database which hosts the knowledge graph.


## Graphs+ Demo

Graph visualization of several days worth of news from different sources powered by the underlying knowledge graph. See the [pipeline](https://github.com/mrkarezina/news-explorer-pipeline) for building a new knowledge graph.

Is medical marijuana just a ploy to legalize marijuana in general? The Obama administration did not make prosecuting medical marijuana even a minor priority. About 85% of Americans support legalizing medical marijuana, and it is estimated that at least several million Americans currently use it. Marijuana itself has more than 100 active components. In particular, marijuana appears to ease the pain of multiple sclerosis, and nerve pain in general. Other patients are already using medical marijuana, but dont know how to tell their doctors about this for fear of being chided or criticized. My advice for doctors is that whether you are pro, neutral, or against medical marijuana, patients are embracing it, and although we dont have rigorous studies and gold standard proof of the benefits and risks of medical marijuana, we need to learn about it, be open-minded, and above all, be non-judgmental."

As a result, surgeons today are rethinking post-surgical pain management strategies. Today, surgeons like her are increasingly turning toward non-opioid medications and other options to manage pain. In many cases, non-opioid pain relievers, such as ibuprofen (Advil) and acetaminophen (Tylenol), will control postsurgical pain if taken as recommended. Limit opioid medication use. When people are having surgery, they should expect to have some pain or discomfort, says Dr. Matzkin. While no one should have to endure excruciating pain, having some pain is okay. Letting people know that its okay to have some pain can actually reduce the amount of pain medications required, says Dr. Chiodo. Use nonmedication strategies to manage pain.",

To date, there is no evidence of public health related problems associated with the use of pure CBD. Currently, many people obtain CBD online without a medical cannabis license. The governments position on CBD is confusing, and depends in part on whether the CBD comes from hemp or marijuana. In numerous studies, CBD was able to reduce the number of seizures, and in some cases it was able to stop them altogether. CBD may offer an option for treating different types of chronic pain. More study in humans is needed in this area to substantiate the claims of CBD proponents about pain control. Side effects of CBD include nausea, fatigue and irritability.",

In 2019, 12.5% of CEOs said M&A best describes their growth strategy, down from 25.8% in 2018. Among the 29 data points studied, the researchers analyzed hospital readmission rates, process of care measurements that gauge how well a hospital provides care to its patients, and patient satisfaction scores. Using that information, they tested whether patient outcomes are influenced by greater hospital market concentration or vertical integration between hospitals and physicians. Before they launched their study, the researchers hypothesized that decreased fragmentation, meaning better coordination among a patient's primary care physician, specialists and admitting and attending hospital physicians, could improve patient care. \"Therefore, we need further research on the ability of patient satisfaction to reflect clinical quality, and if it does not, we need to develop and provide to patients better measures in terms that patients can understand and use.\""

## Deployment

### Core API (Base Directory)
The microservice is deployed on Google Cloud App engine standard. The service must be deployed on at least a F2 instance, F1 runs out of memory.


Add the url for the language processor API in `config.py`. Also add the URL of the Neo4j graph database.
**Note:** The graph DB url will change when the resource is shut down if the DB is hosted on Google Cloud.


Login to the gcloud cli `gcloud auth login`. Deploy to App Engine with config in `app.yaml` by running `gcloud app deploy app.yaml --project <<YOUR PROJECT ID>>` from the base directory.


### RSS Article Curation Serverless Function

## Issues
- The URL of the Compute Engine Neo4j graph can change if instance is shutdown, need to update graph_url variable.
- The newspaper library is modified due to an issue with the parsing. article_downloader.py contains code to extend the original cleaner class. The newspaper Library contains a cleaner class which causes an issue with some websites where the text cannot be extracted. This issue was solved by extending the original cleaner class and removing the cleaning feature when no text is extracted the first time.
